# UserInputValidation

This program asks a user to enter their name, age, email address and phone number.

It runs a check on each data point and validates it before adding the data to an ArrayList.

There are four classes:
Main class asks the user for the input (it throws exception)
Info class contains the ArrayList
Validator class that actually performs the check (it throws exception)
InvalidInputException class handles the exception that the other classes throw
